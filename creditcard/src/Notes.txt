* REACTIVE FORMS:
1. Most of the form logic is driven by configuration in a component CLASS file.
2. More apt for complex forms.
3. Exposes some aspects of the form to us as RxJS Observables.
4. We have to wire up the 'ReactiveFormsModule' to our AppModule to use them.



* TEMPLATE FORMS:
1. Most of the form logic is driven by configuration in a component TEMPLATE file.
2. More apt for simple forms.
3. Harder to deal with dynamic forms
4. We have to wire up the 'FormsModule' to our AppModule to use them.
