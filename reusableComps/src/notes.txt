#Lazy Loading
1.By default, Angular uses Eager Loading, which means that as soon as the app loads, so do all the NgModules, whether or not they are immediately necessary.
2.For large apps with lots of routes, consider lazy loadingâ€”a design pattern that loads NgModules as needed.

For implementing Lazy Loading:
1. Choose which modules should be lazy loaded
2. For each of those modules, remove import statements for those from anywhere in the project.
3. In the AppRoutingModule, define a Route in the 'routes' array to specify when to load up that module.

const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path:'somepath', 
    loadChildren: () => import('./path/to/module').then(m => m.someModule)
  }]

4. In the lazy loaded module's Routing file , edit the 'path' of each route to be relative to the path you specified in the AppRoutingModule.
