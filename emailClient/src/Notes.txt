#Class Based Custom Sync Validator
1. Create a new class to implement your custom Validator
2. Have the class implement the 'Validator' interface
3. Add a 'validate' method to the class, which will be called with a FormGroup or FormControl
4. Validator method should return 'null' if everything is ok, or an object if something is wrong.

#Class Based Custom Async Validator
1. Create a new class to implement your custom Validator
2. Have the class implement the 'AsyncValidator' interface
3. Add a 'validate' method to the class, which will be called with a FormGroup or FormControl
4. Validator method should return an Observable or Promise that will emit 'null' if everything is ok, or an object if something is wrong.
// of() is a shortcut to create Observable

#Requirements for  SignedIn Observable
1. We must be able to get it to emit a new value 'from the outside'
2. We must be able to give it a default,or starting value.
3. New subscribers must be given the value from it immediately after subscribing.

//By default , Angular ignores the http cookies until we use 
 withcredentials:true property explicitly.
Hence use Http Interceptor
